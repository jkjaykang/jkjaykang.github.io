                    Dwarves are the creation of god Hemiad, who is said to have forged each dwarf from a mountain. While the dwarves exposed to the Hemiad Explosion eventually
                    became halflings, dwarves sheltered from the initial explosion maintained their form, the only entity to do so. In result, dwarves are vastly unique in their
                    composition and biology from the other races. While they resemble the human form, dwarves are not made of flesh and blood, and are instead carved from stone.
                    Thus a dwarf's appearance mostly depends on the rock they are "born" from. A dwarf's form does not change throughout their life, and are essentially "born"
                    as a bearded man. While a dwarf does not age, they do degrade, and crumble away once old enough. Unlike other races, there can only be a set number of dwarves at a time, so a
                    dwarf's final task is often to carve their successor.

                <p class="mt-3 ms-3">
                    Despite their cold, hard exterior, dwarves are unthinkably compassoniate and kind. While they are not the best at expressing themselves, dwarves are often the first to lend a helping
                    hand where they can, even at their own
                    incovinience. Due to their nature, a dwarf may come off as condenscending or overprotective, as they will attempt to assist in even the simplest task.
                    When not helping other people, dwarves tend to be talented scholars, and find joy in researching technology and recording history.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3 ms-3">
                    Due to the events that transpired between them and Hemiad, dwarves are firm believers of second, third, or however many chances it takes. They are forgiving to a degree that
                    other race view as unexplaniable, and will never truly hate a person, no matter their deeds. Even when betrayed, trampled, and abandoned, a dwarf will hold firm belief that
                    anyone can change and realize their mistakes. Unfortunately, their nature is often taken advantage of to a varying degree.

                    The cuisine of the dwarves are fascinating as it is strange. Dwarves are master chefs, and some operate restaurants that attract patrons across the lands.
                    While they prepare cuisine of all culture and race at miraculous quality, they also have the ability to make most inedible things edible. The most
                    famous example of this is their ability to prepare stones and rocks as an edible substance, even to other races. While many non-dwarven chefs have attempted
                    to recreate their unique cuisine, all have been met with failure and extreme stomach ache.
