                    Elves are a fascinating race of people. Even putting aside their culture and history, they are a biological marvel.
                    They were originally spirits handcrafted by the goddesss Herna, but after the great explosion, slowly began to resemble humans and their form. Currently,
                    their outward apperance is almost indistinguisable from a human besides their signature pointed ears.

                    The most famous trait of Elves (besides their ear) is longevity. Elves do not age like humans or halflings. Once reaching
                    adulthood their physical appearance does not change. They are by no means immortal, as they are susceptible to wounds and diseases
                    just like humans and halflings, but they do possess a much faster regenerative rate. Scholars believe this regenerative power to be the cause
                    for elves inability to age. They also possess an incredible appetite, which started a common misconception that they are vegetarians, as most elves
                    cannot simply afford a diet that consists of meat without emptying their savings by the end of the week.
