                    Originally spirits created by goddess Avera to tend her forest, elves transformed into
                    what they are today after choosing to stay behind on Antri during the Hemiad Explosion. Elves are similar to humans in size, but tend to be lankier. Instead of rounded ears
                    of the other races, they possess pointed ears that distinguish them easily from humans. Elves do not age after a certain age, and in result do not die of old age, they are still susceptible
                    to wounds and diseases, however.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Elves are easygoing people, often nonchalant to the problems and events around them. They tend to take things slowly, often taking the "scenic route" when given the choice.
                    Due to their relaxed nature, they are not easily angered and hardly holds grudges, thus elves are generally liked and welcomed by those around them. However, coupled with their
                    easygoing nature and extremely long lifespan, elves have a very poor concept of time. They are hardly on time for a gathering, and deadlines are more often a suggestion than a requirement.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Besides their long life and easy going attitude, elves are also known for their extreme appetite, which take many people by surprise due to their skinny build. Given the chance they will
                    desecrate a banquet, and no knowledgable establishment hosts an eating contest that allow elves. A common misconception is that elves are vegetable lovers, but elves only
                    eat vegetables because they would bankrupt themselves if they satisfied their hunger only through meat.

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Due to their origin as a spirit, elves are naturally gifted mages. They can easily grasp magical concepts that befuddle other races, and often discover several
                    new spells and magical fields in their life. Elves tend to enjoy teaching others on magic, seeing magic as a tool that should be shared to improve the lives of
                    those willing to learn it. Thus, it is common to see elven professors at magical universities, or an adventuring elf rambling about magical theories to passerbys.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    On the other hand, elves possess an attiude on magic that other races may consider irreponsible. They show little restraint in developing potentially destructive spells
                    and studies, arguing that any spell is ultimately fashioned to be as destructive or harmless as the caster wills. (They also mutter that a non-elf wouldn't understand the formula anyways)
                    However, after cases of unrestrained mages wreaking havoc
                    with elven spells, elves reluctantly agreed that some spells should be restrained. In accordance, they formed covens that will track and interrogate mages that are developing
                    or practicing spells that can be considered questionable.
