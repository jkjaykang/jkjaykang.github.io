                <p class="mt-3">
                    Short and stout, and great at making teapots (and anything in general), halflings are one of the common races that are scattered throughout most settlement. Related to dwarves,
                    halflings are descendents of dwarves who were exposed to the Hemiad Explosion. Halflings, on average,
                    tend to live a bit longer than humans, and often remain much healthier and lively than an older human. Despite their short stature which average between 4 to 4 and a half
                    feet, halflings are deceptively heavy and strong, and are easily able to match the strength of a human or an elf twice their size.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Halflings in general are extremly socialble and friendly, and even gullible. They will often fall for ridiculous lies and stories, to amusement of many
                    tricksters. While halflings tend to be a target of many friendly jokes and pranks, almost no one dares to antagonize a halfling. Halflings are prideful to a fault
                    and have a notoriously short fuse when insulted, in fact, most bar fights that can involve a halfling will involve one. Many who have been attacked by a halfling
                    describe the experience as "being mauled by a compact bear".
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Although they may have a short temper, halflings are also very apologetic, admitting very quickly to losing their temper and apologizing for their conduct. On the other
                    hand, due to their pride they won't budge on matters that they truly believe they were in the right. Halflings can hold a lifetime grudge easier than any other race,
                    or even any other creature. But, as long as one remains thoughtful when interacting with a halflings, they would have made a halfling friend by the end of the conversation.

                <p class="fst-italic text-end">-Damain Lepa, "on halflings"</p>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Halflings are masters at making almost anything. Clothes weaved by a halfling are the comftiest, swords forged by a halfling cuts the best, and
                    a clock crafted by a halfling is never wrong. Most halflings make their living as some sort of crafters, and often become mentors at guilds after
                    gathering experience. Perfectonists due to the love for their craft and their prideful nature, it is often said that a halfling master scraps a hundred times
                    before finishing a work.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Due to their renown, figures such as kings and heroes will request a halfling master to craft something. More often than not, they are met with an apology
                    or a flat refusal along the lines of "don't feel like it", but if they do accept a request, their work often goes down in history. Be it the sword that slew
                    the great monster or the shield of a legendary king, it will often have a signature of a halfling engraved on it.
