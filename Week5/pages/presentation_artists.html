      Starry Night
    </h1>
    <p>
      StarryNight was a navigational tool built in 1999 for the site Rhizome as a way to naviagate posts on its email discussion list. Rhizome's email discussion list was a forum for artists working in emergent forms of media.

      In StarryNight every forum post is represented as a star that can be clicked on to access the post. Stars become brighter everytime a user interacts with them. Posts are assigned key words and posts that share the same key words become connected in a "constellation" of different stars.

      StarryNight was created by Mark Tribe, Alexander Galloway, and Martin Wattenberg.

       Quote from Tribe on StarryNight:
       I felt it was important that we begin to develop an aesthetic and theoretical vocabulary to discuss and understand these emergent forms of media art. I initially thought of it as a place for discussion, exchange of ideas, and information, but also for presentation, so people could see one anothers work.
