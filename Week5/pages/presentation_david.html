        Starry Night, What I Like/Analysis
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Stars Getting Brighter
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stars in the night sky grow brighter the more people interact with them. The stars growth shows the user how they have contributed to Rhizomes community just by being there and caring about the posts. Through this act of simply caring about a post you are literally making it easier for others to see that text. I found this to be a clever visual way to think about how most social media platforms still work today. A single view, like, or comment, may feel so meaningless but it is not. By simply interacting with a piece of content on sites such as Facebook, Youtube, or Twitter you are making that content easier to see by others. This principle goes for the negative posts you interact with and the positive ones. However, unlike todays social media platforms, in a Starry Night when a star gets brighter it does not make it harder for other stars to be found. Navigating to a dim star is just as easy as navigating to a bright star. In this way Starry Night makes its posts equally accessible, something that I am not used to when interacting with modern social media platforms.

    <h2>
        A Constellation of Ideas
    </h2>
    <p>
        A single thought sent out into the internet can create a web of connected ideas. One idea can spark an idea in someone else and that persons thoughts will reach someone else and so on. In StarryNight a single star casted out into the night sky eventually creates a constellation. 
        Connected only by key words, the community of Rhizome was able to create constealltions with wide scopes of thoughts that all built upon one another. Starry Night is a functional navigation tool but it is also a beautiful example of how information and ideas can grow online.
