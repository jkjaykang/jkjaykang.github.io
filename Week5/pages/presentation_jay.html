        STARRY NIGHTS-Thoughts

    <h2>
        Art of Many Layers
    </h2>

    <p>
        Starry night is an art piece with a lot of layers. First of all it's an art piece of itself, quite pleasant looking one at that too.
        I'm sure everyone has at least stared at the night sky in awe, unless they were born and lived in a large city, then they probably didn't
        see too much. Huzzah for pollution. But it's also an archive of forums of exchanges and discussions between artists. So the art piece itself
        was a useful tool for artists who I assume created art on their own too. But, even beyond that, a user can interact with the art, and in doing
        that changes the art, making stars brighter. That's three layers, which is a lot. What drew me to the art piece at first was simply it's aesthetics,
        but it was a pleasant experience to find out that this netart was much more than that.

        Starry night of our own.

    <p>
        Looking at Starry Night, I thought of what my own "Starry Night" would look like. I am not much of a person for interacting with too many people on
        the internet, especially random people like some people constanly do on applications like discord. However, I'm sure I definently interacted with much more 
        people on the web than I thought I did, intentionally or not. Just looking at the brightness of my internet stars or sites I have visited would be
        pretty interesting, although I bet I wouldn't be too proud of it. It's also very neat to know the fact that Google or Facebook most definently have
        a "Starry Night" of me. Technology!
